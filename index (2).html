    <h3>Hi Everyone,</h3>
    <p>
    I, being someone who enjoys to spend my extra time doing what I love most or something impactful at a long run and some of those activities include stuffs like cooking, reading, writing, thinking, playing, designing, outreaches and lots more</p>
    <p>Now, Cooking might be of more interest to me because I view it as an art.
    An art takes a considerable ammount of time, work and effort, and not just that, but the feeling of every fabric of nature in what you do.
    You see in cooking, from the Looks to the aroma down to the taste, everthing needs to be in check and for everything to ba as such,the following resources would be needed</p>
    <ul><strong>A pot</strong></ul>
    <ul><strong>A Fire source</strong></ul>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong> such as<en> Maggi Cubes, Salt, Curry, Thyme, Cabbage, Carrots, Green beans, Peas, Mayonnaise etc</en></ul>
    <ul><strong>A beautiful plate and a handsome spoon</strong><en> lol ...just for fun by the way</en></ul>
    <br>
    <p>Okay, with all that been said let me take you through this art i love. For instance I would love to be cooking jollof rice today, so wirh all the ingredients or resources needed all chopped and diced, grounded and washed, i then place my pot on the lited cooker, turn in some oil into it and add the wonderful ingredients into the heated oil, and these ingredients which i call the fri-ables include the onino, tomatoes etc pending on how rich you are at the moment. After the fri-ables have been fried you gently add water and then you could cover the pot and allow to heat</p>
    <p>After the water is heated, i then add my washed perboiled rice, and  the buds stimulators, these includes the nasal and taste such as the curry, thyme, maggi, salt and other seasonings and if money allows i could add the enjoy-ables such as cooked diced beef or liver, and after that i allow to cook for about 30-35 minutes and then i add other ingredients such as green beans, carrots, peas etc, then i allow to cook for about 5-10 minutes. Then Wow! my FOOD is done but not ready though, i then begin the preparation of the salad and after that when all is set and in place then my Jollof Rice is Ready when just as seen below.
    And Yummy to my stomach it goes with a cup of wine to push through</p>
